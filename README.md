# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction Project!  
In this project, we build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, sex, ticket fare, and more.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Description

The Titanic dataset is a classic machine learning problem from Kaggle.  
The goal is to **predict survival** based on passenger information such as:

- Age
- Fare
- Sex
- Pclass (Passenger class)
- Family size (engineered feature)

We clean the data, engineer new features, scale the data, and apply machine learning models.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- KNNImputer
- StandardScaler
- Logistic Regression / Random Forest (add whichever model you used)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values using **KNN Imputation**.
   - Log transformation on skewed `Fare` column.
   - Feature engineering: Created `FamilySize`.

2. **Feature Encoding**
   - Binary encoding for `Sex`.
   - One-hot encoding for `Embarked` (after fixing missing values).

3. **Model Building**
   - Split into training and test sets.
   - Standardized features using **StandardScaler**.
   - Trained models and evaluated accuracy.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GojoSatoru07/Titanic-Survival-Prediction-project.git
```

2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the main script or open the notebook:

```bash
python main.py
```
or open the `.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter/Colab.

## ðŸ“Š Results

(âœ… You can add a line here like:  
*"Our Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 78% on the test set."*  
Or whatever your final result was!)

## âœ¨ Future Improvements

- Try other models like Random Forest, XGBoost.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning.
- Use ensemble techniques.
- Visualize feature importance.
